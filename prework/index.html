  <h1>Randy Perez</h1>
  <h2 style="font-style: italic">Welcome to ___, make yourself at home.</h2>
  <p id="aboutMe">I'd like to describe myself as very Randy but I guess that wouldn't really make much sense to you. I'm the type of person who really likes the stuff I like. I look up the best order to watch, read or play things. Sometimes the research is just as fun as actually enjoying the thing I'm interested in. I can't skip the first movie and go straight into the second one. I would go insane. Even when it doesn't matter and the two things aren't even related. It's one of those things where even I don't understand.I really enjoy improving. No matter what it is. That moment when you finally understand the terribly explained IKEA instructions and put the bookshelf together or when you can finally do a layup with your left hand. </p>
  <h3 class="navyHeader">I don't know how to explain why or how but I can somehow relate to this photo at all times.</h3>
