  <p style="font-size: 20px">Video games are my favorite medium. If I could only keep one out movies, tv, books and videogames, I'm easily picking video games.
     I thoroughly enjoy everything about games. The history, the discussions, studying the design philosophy, all of it. So take this as me introducing you to three glimpses of me. </p>

  <p>I love celeste for a lot of reasons. Its themes of battling depression anxiety and self hatred. Its awesome art; Its whimsical and mysterious soundtrack. But above all is its unflinching requirement of mastery. Unlike most games you cannot beat the entirety of Celeste without achieving mastery of its mechanics. That paired with its intuitive tutorialization and level design makes it one of my favorite games of all time. </p>

  <p>I grew up with Sonic The Hedgehog. When I was a kid I absolutely adored him but I grew up with his 3d games. Games that as I grew up I constantly heard people say were bad games. Especially after he had a spree of terrible games in the mid 2000s and his reputation took a nose dive. So one day I decided that I would play every Sonic game, and I started with original and worked my way backwards through over thirty games. And after all that, Sonic The Hedgehog 3 is my favorite. Something I think eight year old Randy would be absolutely flabbergasted by since he did not like those games at all no matter how hard he tried. Ultimately Sonic 3 is my go to game when I'm not sure what do. It's my favorite game from my favorite character ever.</p>

<p>Last but surely not least we have Bloodborne. A game that I could replay forever. Bloodborne is a game about eldritch horror in the Victorian inspired city of Yharnam.Bloodborne tackles the themes of science vs faith, humanity’s unending struggle with power and authority and many others. Bloodborne has gotten me out of some tough times. Somehow this game that has the reputation of being one of the hardest games of all time, is my comfort food. Yharnam is where I want to go back to when life has become too unpredictable or chaotic.<br>
  <br>
Honestly I could’ve gone on much longer about these games but I feel like my nerding out is probably going through one ear and coming out the other. I hope everyone has a hobby they enjoy as much as I enjoy video games.</p>
